Future topics to be covered:
- Semantic versioning (SemVer) adoption
- Version numbering scheme
- Release cadence and schedule
- Changelog generation (manual vs. automated)
- Tagging strategy in Git
- Hotfix procedures
- Pre-release and beta versioning
- Deprecation policy
- API versioning for breaking changes
